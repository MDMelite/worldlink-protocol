# Collaborative Assistant Example

This example demonstrates how multiple agents collaborate over the WorldLink Protocol to fulfill a user request, as described in the main documentation.

## Agents Involved

The following agents are involved in this example:

1. **UI Agent (ui-1):** Responsible for capturing the user's query.
2. **Language Understanding Agent (nlu-1):** Interprets the user's query and extracts the intent.
3. **Planning Agent (planner-1):** Breaks down the user's request into a series of subtasks.
4. **Research Agent (data-1):** Gathers necessary data based on the planner's requests.
5. **Execution Agent (exec-1):** Executes the subtasks and formats the final output.
6. **Compliance Agent (compliance-1):** (Optional) Performs a quality assurance check on the output.

## Running the Example

This example assumes you have already set up your development environment as described in the main [README.md](../README.md) file, including installing the WorldLink Client Library for your preferred language (Python or JavaScript).

To run the collaborative assistant example, you will typically need to run each agent in a separate terminal or process. Here are the general steps:

### 1. Navigate to the Example Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to the `examples/collaborative-assistant/` directory.

```
cd examples/collaborative-assistant/
```

### 2. Run the Agents

You will need to run each agent. The specific commands might depend on the implementation language of each agent (which is not specified in the current documentation). Below are general examples for Python and JavaScript, assuming each agent has a corresponding script (e.g., `ui_agent.py`, `nlu_agent.js`, etc.).

#### For Python Agents:

Open multiple terminal windows and in each, navigate to the `examples/collaborative-assistant/` directory. Then run each agent:

```
python ui_agent.py
python nlu_agent.py
python planner_agent.py
python research_agent.py
python exec_agent.py
# Optional:
python compliance_agent.py
```

#### For JavaScript Agents (Node.js):

Similarly, open multiple terminal windows, navigate to the directory, and run each agent:

```
node ui_agent.js
node nlu_agent.js
node planner_agent.js
node research_agent.js
node exec_agent.js
// Optional:
node compliance_agent.js
```

**Note:** You might need to configure each agent with the address of the WorldLink Protocol bus if it's not running on the default `localhost:8080`. This configuration would typically be done within the agent's script.

### 3. Interact with the UI Agent

Once all the agents are running, you can interact with the UI Agent. This might involve typing a query into the terminal where the UI Agent is running, or it might have a separate user interface (depending on how it's implemented).

For example, if the UI Agent is a simple command-line interface, you might see a prompt like:

```
Enter your request:
```

You can then enter the example query:

```
Can you generate a marketing plan for my AI-powered productivity app?
```

### 4. Observe the Collaboration

You should then be able to observe the agents communicating and collaborating. You might see output in the terminals of the other agents as they receive packets, process them, and send new packets.

### 5. View the Final Output

The final marketing plan generated by the Execution Agent should eventually be presented by the UI Agent, likely in its terminal or through its user interface.

## Further Exploration

This example provides a basic illustration of collaborative agents. You can explore the code for each agent (if available) in the respective subdirectories (e.g., `ui-module`, `nlu-agent`, `planner-agent`, `research-agent`, `exec-agent`, `compliance-agent`) to understand their specific roles and how they interact using the WorldLink Protocol.

**Note:** This `README.md` provides general instructions based on the conceptual description of the collaborative assistant. The actual steps to run the example might vary depending on the specific implementation of the agents. Please refer to any specific documentation or code comments within the agent directories for more detailed instructions.
